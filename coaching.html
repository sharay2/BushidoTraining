            <p>I started my training journey when I was still a young middle school basketball player. Starting my training in basic calisthenics sparked a passion for training and personal improvement. Little did I know this would develop into a lifelong endeavor. Once I was a sophomore in high school, I had a small amount of exposure to weight training but overall enjoyed it. It took a detrimental injury later that year where I tore my ACL and meniscus that began my transition into powerlifting. Torn between my love of basketball and my newfound enjoyment in powerlifting, I decided to pursue powerlifting due my potential in the sport. Soon after I would place second at state in the local high school federation, IHSPLA, and then eventually win state and break my first state record. After high school, I would compete at the University of Illinois at Chicago’s powerlifting team where I had great success under their powerlifting club. After a few years there I climbed up to become the president of the club where I would get a taste of what it’s like to lead a group of lifters through multiple local competitions as well as multiple collegiate nationals. During this time I began coaching in the summer of 2020, an unlikely start to a career so driven by personal connection. From then I have grown to have coached over 50 athletes and am now also the Head Powerlifting Coach at the high school where I had my start. I have coached athletes of varying backgrounds and from different levels. 

Throughout this time I have won multiple state championships as well as a national championship. At the same time, I’ve broken multiple state and national records.</p>
